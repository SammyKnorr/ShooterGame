# ShooterGame
A small two-player Python game. Each player controls a sprite with either w and s or an up arrow and a down arrow to move the player. They then use the d or left arrow key to shoot. When one player wins a victory screen is shown and you can play again by hitting the space bar.

Start the game by running the game.py file.
